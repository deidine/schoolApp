Please generate Flutter code for the UI and logic of the following images. Focus on the user interface and user experience, and try to replicate the exact layout and design as in the images , just the UI elements. Feel free to take your time to ensure the layout is precise and well-structured. I'm looking for clean, organized code with proper widget hierarchy. Thank you
